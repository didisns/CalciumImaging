# CalciumImaging

This folder contains all the code I used to analyse the calcium imaging data. 

imageGateway.m is the main program, written by Gian Michele Ratto. In my work I used it to obtain a binarised version of my calcium imaging data.
All other functions are called from the 'parent' program imageGateway.
The Image Processing Toolbox is required to use ImageGateway. 

The other program contained in this folder is particleanalysisdidi.m, written by me to process calcium transients. 
The comments on the top of the program explain its functioning and required inputs.
